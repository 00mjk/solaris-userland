#
# This patch fixes an issue where gss_store_cred(), when called with
# overwrite_creds is 1, is not overwriting the ccache file which causes
# problems when trying to get service tickets and there is an expired tgt cred
# in that ccache.
#
# This problem has been reported to MIT via this ticket: 8010 gss_store_cred
# should initialize ccache and work with collections
#
# Patch source: in-house
