gnutls_cipher.c in libgnutls in GnuTLS before 2.12.17 and 3.x before 3.0.15 
does not properly handle data encrypted with a block cipher, which allows 
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap memory corruption and 
application crash) via a crafted record, as demonstrated by a crafted 
GenericBlockCipher structure.
Status:
Need to determine if this patch has been sent upstream.
