.SH NAME
hal-cups-utils - automatic queue configuration for CUPS
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
hal-cups-utils is a Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) plugin module that
automatically creates print queues under the Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS)
for printers detected by HAL.  When a printer is detected by the HAL framework,
HAL activates hal-cups-utils to attempt to create a corresponding print queue
under the CUPS print service.  If the CUPS print service is not active, no
action is taken.  See http://fedorahosted.org/hal-cups-utils/ for additional
information.
