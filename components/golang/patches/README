To make it easier to manage the large number of patches expected for Go at
different points in the release cycle (due to the frequent updates by
upstream and our own internal developmenmt), the patches in this directory
are named as follows:

XXXX-$name.patch

The XXXX (matching git's 4-digit patch numbering scheme) should be a
numeric value in the range of:

0000-0499:      patches taken directly from upstream repository release
                branch

0500-0599:      patches we've contributed to upstream, but are not yet part
                of the current release

0600-0699:      patches not suitable for upstream that we need to build;
                these should be rare

0700-9999:      reserved for future use
