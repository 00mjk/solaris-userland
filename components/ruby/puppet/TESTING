A STC suite with persistent errors exists but is not used on a regular basis.

Generic testing uses pre-built rspec tests with CI (travis-CI, AppVeyor)
based on github integration where coverage has been extended post modification.

While spec files can be installed by setting the facet.optional.test=true
tests cannot be run on Solaris without modifications to the environment
providing the required ruby gems.

See Puppet Documentation for an overview of testing with rspec
https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/blob/master/docs/rspec_tutorial.md

Core puppet type and provider testing is performed by Puppet for a range of
operating systems including Solaris 10 and 11.

Adhoc individual module testing may be performed by reviewing the Setup and
Usage portions of the README.md shipped with each module.

e.g. Testing install behavior with mysql
puppet apply -e "include '::mysql::server'"
