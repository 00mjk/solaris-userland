This package is a collected set of SMF services for building various desktop
cache/metadata files after install - long term I suspect each service should
be moved into the package it's building the cache for, but this is how it was
packaged so far.

Versions 0.2.7 and earlier were maintained as a standalone project in a
separate source repository on opensolaris.org, including GNU autoconf &
automake scripts & Makefiles that just installed the SMF manifests & method
scripts to a proto area for packaging.  After opensolaris.org was shut
down, further updates were made as patches applied in the desktop spec-files.

Version 0.2.8 drops the configure script & Makefiles, incorporates the
patches previously applied in the spec-files, and just checks the files
directly into the Userland gate, allowing the package publication step
to take care of putting them into the right places.  The ChangeLog from
the prior versions is provided to retain some history - for more history,
there is a mirror on github of the former opensolaris.org svn repo.
