.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
PNG (Portable Network Graphics) is an extensible file format for the
lossless, portable, well-compressed storage of raster images\&. PNG provides
a patent-free replacement for GIF and can also replace many common uses of
TIFF\&. Indexed-color, grayscale, and truecolor images are supported, and an
optional alpha channel\&. Sample depths range from 1 to 16 bits\&.
.PP
PNG is designed to work well in online viewing applications, such as
the World Wide Web, and is fully streamable with a progressive display option\&.
PNG is robust, and provides both full file integrity checking, and fast simple
detection of common transmission errors\&. PNG can store gamma and chromaticity
data for improved color matching on heterogeneous platforms\&.
