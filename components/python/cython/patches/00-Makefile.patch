Patch to prevent setup.py clobbering built sources - important if
we want to do an incremental build, or just execute the build,
install, test and publish targets as separate invocations of gmake.

Not considered worthwhile pushing upstream since this is purely an
optimization for our build process.

Patch was written in-house.
