# Using gsed with a specific set of transforms to be applied to the test
# results to try to normalize them, was problematic. It resulted in 8
# different ~650Kb master test files. Several of these lines needed to be
# deleted (as opposed to being normalized) because they appear in a
# non-deterministic order.
#
# Using nawk to just extract lines starting with:
# [FAIL]: ...
# [ERROR]: ...
# Ran XXXX tests in ...
# FAILED ...
# OK
# and stripping out the random portions (like time to complete the tests),
# resulted in 8 master test files each less than 1Kb in size.
