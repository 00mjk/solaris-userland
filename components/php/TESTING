Internal Test Suites:
The internal test suites for the php interpreters are unstable from
run to run.  Sporatic PASS / FAILS happen for some unknown reason.
Still, 99.9% of the test results match the stored results.
I tend to focus on Summary towards the end of the test run and in particular
I look at the last percentage on the last line; 98.1%.
I think that means 98.1% of the tests run passed.
This shows a normal and acceptable result.

TEST RESULT SUMMARY
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Exts skipped    :   18
Exts tested     :   62
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Number of tests : 13992             11855
Tests skipped   : 2137 ( 15.3%) --------
Tests warned    :    6 (  0.0%) (  0.1%)
Tests failed    :  173 (  1.2%) (  1.5%)
Expected fail   :   41 (  0.3%) (  0.3%)
Tests passed    : 11635 ( 83.2%) ( 98.1%)


AMP Configuration Testing:
While the internal test suites show that the interpreter is healthy what
really matters is does PHP work in a web configuration.

These instructions are for testing php in an AMP (Apache, Mysql, PHP) style
configuration.

Installing Wordpress
====================

Following:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress
to install.

Use mysql 5.5 for now.
mysql 5.7 has some authentication restriction which I haven't figured
out yet.
# pkg set-mediator --no-backup-be -v -V 5.5 mysql
# svcadm enable mysql:version_55
# svcs -p mysql
  [Patience.  mysql is slow starting up sometimes.  Keep checking.]
# cp /etc/apache2/2.4/samples-conf.d/php5.6.conf /etc/apache2/2.4/conf.d/
# vi /etc/php/5.6/conf.d/extensions.ini
uncomment
	extension=mysql.so
	extension=mysqli.so
	extension=pdo_mysql.so

# svcs -p http
If apache24 is NOT online do:
# svcadm enable apache24
If apache24 is online do:
# svcadm restart apache24
# svcs -p http

1) # cd /var/apache2/2.4/htdocs
   Move index.html out of the way so we get a directory listing.
   # mv index.html itworks.html
   Optionally create this file.  Browse to this file to check php information.
   # cat > phpinfo.php
<?php
phpinfo();
?>

   # wget http://wordpress.org/latest.zip
   # unzip latest.zip
   Creates the directory wordpress

2) Create the Database and a User

   As root; make a database
   We need the choose the following values before creating a mysql database.
   These are only samples.  NOT something you must use but you can use.
   DB_NAME=wordpress
   DB_USER=wordpress
   DB_PASSWORD="{root's password}"
   DB_HOST=localhost

   # mysql
   mysql> create database wordpress;
   mysql> grant all privileges on wordpress.* to "wordpress"@"localhost" identified by "{root's password}";
   mysql> flush privileges;
   mysql> exit;

   mysql> show databases;    ## to see all databases
   mysql> drop database {database};    ## to delete {database}

3) # cd /var/apache2/2.4/htdocs/wordpress
   # cp wp-config-sample.php wp-config.php
   [edit wp-config.php and enter values listed above]:
   DB_NAME
   DB_USER
   DB_PASSWORD
   DB_HOST

   Save the file.

4) In your web browser to go:
   http://{testing machine}.us.oracle.com/wordpress/wp-admin/install.php

   Site Title = {your choice}
   User = admin
   Password = {root's password}
   CHECKBOX Confirm use of weak password
   Your E-mail: {your email address}

   Click Install WordPress

5) Your wordpress site is ready as:
   http://{testing machine}.us.oracle.com/wordpress/
   Click Log In
   Username: admin
   Password: "{root's password}"

6) Test the site.
   Top left corner.  Click on house icon.
   Scroll down to see the current content.
   Click New -> Post
   Fill in the Title and add some content to the large edit area.
   Click Publish on the right.
   Top left corner.  Click on the house icon again.
   Scroll down.  You should see your new post.
   Click on EDIT that appears in your new post and change something and Publish again.


Installing Joomla
=================

# cd /var/apache2/2.4/htdocs

## Can no longer download directly from Joomla website.
## Download with browser and copy manually.

https://downloads.joomla.org/

# mkdir joomla
# cd joomla
# unzip ~/Downloads/Joomla_3.7.1-Stable-Full_Package.zip

Enable mysql if you have not already.
# svcadm enable svc:/application/database/mysql:version_55

See wordpress comments about enabling php extensions.
# vi /etc/php/5.6/conf.d/extensions.ini
    uncomment:
    extension=zip.so
# vi /etc/php/5.6/php.ini
    Change output_buffering to:
    output_buffering = Off
Restart apache to pick up these changes.
# svcadm restart apache24

# cd /var/apache/2.4/htdocs/joomla
# chown webservd:webservd .
# chown -R webservd:webservd *

Start installation by browsing here:
http://{testing machine}.us.oracle.com/joomla/installation/index.php

Then configure:


Main Configuration:
    Site Name: {your choice}
    Your Email: {your email address}
    Admin Username: admin
    Admin Password: {root's password}

    Click Next

Database Configuration:
    Database Type: Mysqli
    Host Name: localhost
    Username: root
    Password: [leave blank]
    Database Name: {your choice}
    Table Prefix: [don't change]
    Old Database Process: {your choice}

    Click Next

Finalization:
    Install Sample Data: {pick one like Learn Joomla}
    Email Configuration:  {Yes or No}

    Everything else displays the configuration.
    Everything should be green except perhaps Site Offline
    and Mcrypt Support.  We disable Mcrypt for weak security reasons.

    Click Install

Congratulations! Joomla! is now installed.

    Now REMOVE or RENAME the installation directory,
    /var/apache2/2.4/htdocs/joomla/installation
