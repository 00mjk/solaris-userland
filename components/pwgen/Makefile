# IPS Package versions contain sequences of non-negative (for now) integers,
# separated by dots.  Leading zeroes are not allowed, due to ordering
# ambiguity. For example, IPS team has to massage "06" into "6" and thus IPS 
# version of pwgen 2.06 becomes 2.6.  IPS_COMPONENT_VERSION is by default
# set to $(COMPONENT_VERSION) but in this case it has to be set specifically
# to comply with the convention described above.

# configure in pwgen is generated by autoconf 2.13, which does not accept the
# variables like CC, CXX, etc.  The solution is to generate a new configure
# using modern autoconf available on the build system (version 2.63 in the
# time of creating this makefile).
