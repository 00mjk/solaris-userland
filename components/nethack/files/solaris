# root of the proto area.

# GAME is not set in Makefile.utl, but we need to have it set.
# CLIENT_HACKDIR needs to be set separately from HACKDIR, since we use it
# as a substitution in the nethack script, and can't have the workspace
# path embedded in that script.  The rest should have DESTDIR prepended.
