+.SH NOTES
+As of Solaris 12, rsyslog is now the default Solaris logger.
+
+When the service is enabled the first time, an attempt is made
+to see if any /etc/syslog.conf (see syslog.conf(5)),
+entries might need migrating and if
+so rsyslog is brought up in a degraded SMF state.
+
+Please visit /etc/rsyslog.conf (see rsyslog.conf(5)), and customize as needed.
+
+Then clear the service:
+
+# svcadm clear svc:/system/system-log:rsyslog
