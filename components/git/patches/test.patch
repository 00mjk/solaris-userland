A couple of tests need patching:

  - There's a garbled sed command in the clone tests, which works for GNU
    sed, but not for Solaris.

  - Because we're doing the build in a symlink farm, one of the diff tests
    thinks that we're changing the type of the files from symlink to file,
    so the diffs come out wrong.  Rather than cleverly mucking around with
    the working directory vs the repo directory, we just cat the files as
    real files into place.

The first patch is probably fine for upstream; the latter perhaps less so.
