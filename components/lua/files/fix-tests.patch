Fix to allow the lua self-tests to work.

Note that the proper solution is to fix:

  19661394 ferror differences between Ubuntu and Solaris.

but until that happens, we can comment out a couple of asserts when trying to
read from a file that has been opened in "w" mode.

Note that we cannot apply this patch with all the other lua patches at
"gmake prep" time, because the lua tests are a separate download that's
only unpacked when we are actually testing the component.

This patch will not be sent upstream.
