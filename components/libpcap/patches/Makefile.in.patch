# This patch comes from Oracle. It makes pcap-int.h available
# for inclusion into the resulting package delivering libpcap.
# It is needed to build pflogd (we need 'struct pcap' at least).
#
# I filed a bug for upstream at
#   https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/libpcap/issues/457
# however, upstream does not like this idea as they consider
# this header file 'internal' and subject to possible future
# changes that would break its consumers.
