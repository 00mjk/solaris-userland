# The man page change here is Solaris-specific and thus is not being
# contributed back to the upstream community.  The servconf.c change
# was developed in-house and has been submitted upstream to OpenSSH for
# their consideration:
# https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2278
#
# Update - accepted upstream:
# https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/commit/ac908c1eeacccfa
#
# OpenSSH normally updates lastlog when users login and reads lastlog to
# determine the last login time of the user however on Solaris the
# pam_unix_session(5) module handles both of these tasks so we compile
# OpenSSH with --disable-lastlog to disable all lastlog references.
# This means the sshd_config option of PrintLastLog is now ignored and
# can't be changed so we update sshd's configuration parsing to flag
# this as unsupported and update the man page here.
