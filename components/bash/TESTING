Bash test results are stored in test/*/test-64-results. They are then filtered
by COMPONENT_TEST_TRANSFORMS to make the test produce stable/reproducible
results. Unfortunatelly COMPONENT_TEST_TRANSFORMS remove any problems
encountered too. This is not ideal and should be fixed. The problem is that
bash tests are sensitive to environment they are executed in (your ~/.bash*
files for example). It's not easy to tell that bash tests finished
successfully, you have to read it through.

To compare the results before and after a fix one has to store test-64-results
file and compare it to the one generated after your change.
