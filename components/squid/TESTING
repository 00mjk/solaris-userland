Squid comes with a set of tests, so don't forget to run "gmake test"
and make sure that the output matches the master test results.

These squid tests use cppunit. Currently this requires a version of cppunit
installed that have been built with the GNU version 5.3 compilers.


To test manually follow along in the book
Squid Proxy Server 3.1 Beginner's Guide Page 34

Add these three lines to the top of /etc/squid/squid.conf:

cache_dir ufs /var/squid/cache/ 500 16 256
acl my_machine src 192.0.2.21    # Replace this IP address with your IP address
http_access allow my_machine

You might need to remove or comment out the following lines or Squid
will fail to start:

  # acl manager proto cache_object

Make sure apache is running.

  $ sudo svcs apache24

Start squid:

  $ sudo svcadm enable squid

On your desktop set your web browser to proxy through this squid:

Edit -> Preferences -> Advanced -> Network -> Settings

      Check: Manual proxy configuration
      HTTP Proxy: <squid servers IP address>    Port: 3128

  Save

Enter <squid server URL> in your web browser. You should be accessing squid
and seeing files stored in the http server on that machine.

Enter <squid server URL>:897 in your web browser and squid should complain.
If those two things happen, then squid is working properly.
