In Solaris 11.4, we have normalized man pages. See PSARC 2015/428.
This means that what was section 1m, is now section 8. But currently
only for Solaris 11.4.

This patch should eventually be sent upstream, but for that to happen
it will need to be reworked into a form that will be acceptable for
all versions of Solaris. Plus the Solaris section also needs to be
split from the HP-UX section.  Until then, we are just using this
Solaris 11.4 specific patch.
