This suite also runs fuzz tests, which means it pumps out a lot of
random warnings and scary messages.  Ignore them, except to mentally note
that the fuzz testing did occur.  The transform-results script gets rid
of everything that varies from test to test or architecture to architecture,
and decides PASS/FAIL based upon the results of the transform.

NOTE: cleanup does not restore the previous Kerberos setup.

TODO: debug GSS-SPNEGO mechansim and/or test

To run testsuite:

PREP:  gmake tarball in comoponents/cyrus-sasl

On a build machine with kernel zones:

    log into kz as yourself
    cd [ your workspace /components/cyrus-sasl ]
    gmake tarball   (if you didn't already do this)
    su 
    cd [ your workspace /components/cyrus-sasl/sasltest ]
    ./run_testsuite
    [ answer y to "Existing KDC config will be destroyed, okay to proceed?" ]

    [ you can do more runs, setup_testsuite will not be re-run unless you 
    	do ./cleanup ]

    [gather results]

    optional:  ./cleanup  

On a lab machine:

    make sure you are ready and willing to destroy your kerberos setup
    cd /var/tmp
    gtar zxf sasltest.tgz
    cd sasltest

    ./run_testsuite
    [ answer y to "Existing KDC config will be destroyed, okay to proceed?" ]

    [ you can do more runs, setup_testsuite will not be re-run unless you 
    	do ./cleanup ]

    [gather results]

    optional:  ./cleanup
